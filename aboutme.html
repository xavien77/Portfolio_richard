            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>From the first day of middle school till graduation, the question that has always driven me crazy is, “what do you want to do in the future?” I never truly understood how to answer that question; the future always seemed too far away for me to think about that. However, there was still an inkling in the back of my head that I had an answer all along. That answer was coding, during my freshman year, I took an intro to python programming class, and I instantly fell in love with writing code, looking at a problem and finding new and intuitive ways to solve problems is so much fun! And now, in college, I have learned much more about c++ programming language that my path has never seemed more apparent than it is right now. I am genuinely excited to start my career in the field of my dreams and am waiting with excitement for someone to give me that opportunity!</p>
